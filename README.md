#mylyn-tbg


This is a Eclipse Mylyn connector for The Bug Genie bug tracker, modelled after the bitbucket plugin written by Shuji Watanabe and Peter Lupo. It is now in the early stage of development, has very limited features, it's probably full of bugs and there is no release yet. YMMV.

master branch currently works against [my fork](https://github.com/guidograzioli/thebuggenie) of TBG, while 3.2 is abandoned and just for reference.

##STATUS

- Repository configuration and authentication (ok).
- Query wizard (issues with task list).
- But editor (just started, partial data).

##TODO

- Load comments.
- Support query with multiple issuetype values (both here and TBG route).
- Support metadata and custom fields.
- File attachments (make screenshot like mantis-bt connector)
